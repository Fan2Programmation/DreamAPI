# Java API for HTTP Interface between Android App and PSQL Database

This project provides a Java API to facilitate communication between [Dreamcatcher](https://github.com/Fan2Programmation/Dreamcatcher) Android App and a PostgreSQL database using HTTP requests. It's built with **Spring Boot** and offers endpoints for Dreamcatching.

## How to Run the Server

Clone the repository to your machine and go into your new folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fan2Programmation/intermediate.git
cd intermediate
```

To start the server, open a terminal/command prompt and run the following commands:

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

This will start the Spring Boot application on your local machine, typically accessible at `http://localhost:8095`.
